# CodingThrone Courses
@FOUNDERS feel free to go about the main branch as you wish. For now, meaing
until further directions are explicitely given, create a new branch named after
your github username and create a folder for each course named accordingly.

Incase of confusion, copy structure of branch **rbrtbrnschn**
